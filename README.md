TODO:

2. Figure out icon location logic so we can always diplays app's icon
3. Add fallback when unable to find icon
4. Header check isn't always working because of comments and potentially empty top lines
5. Good keyboard navigation -- would love to make Vimium work or something
6. Finish Help page.
