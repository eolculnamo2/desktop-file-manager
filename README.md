# Tauri + Svelte + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, Svelte and TypeScript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

TODO:
1. Add create validations on both front end submit and back end receive
2. Could add notify.rs to update .desktop list in case its modified elsewhere
3. Figure out icon location logic so we can always diplays app's icon
4. Add fallback when unable to find icon
5. Header check isn't always working because of comments and potentially empty top lines
6. Add logs to UI
7. Good keyboard navigation -- would love to make Vimium work or something
